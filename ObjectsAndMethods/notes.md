# Notes on Objects and Classes

### Methods

* instance variables
* access identifier
  * public - anything can see thing
  * private - only class can see it
* method header == signature line
* accesor/getter give us info abt the class
* mutator/setter allow us to change the state of the class
* methods must have different paramters - if the order AND type are the same, the methods are duplicates
* `toString()` is an example of overriding methods from superclass
* `static` means method is owned by class

### Constructors

* Overloading is when you override but with constructors
* required for making objects

### Other

* implement means to write the code for something
